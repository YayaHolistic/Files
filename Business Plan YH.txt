1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1. COMPANY OVERVIEW 
Yaya Holistic LLC was founded by Mr. Derek Schops in 2019 and incorporated in 2020. The vegan-friendly brand stands for achieving optimal health through alkaline nutrition.
The company offers safe, effective, and nutritional plant-based supplements sourced entirely from whole foods to support Optimal Alkaline Health. 
The products are sold through its online store, the product range includes plant-based dietary supplement blends, herbal teas, plant-based cosmetics, and EMF protectors (Orgone).
As a value-based brand, Yaya Holistic aims to offer more than just products to its customers by creating professional educational content and assuming an advisory role to promote the importance of alkaline nutrition and offer insights on the improvement of individual wellbeing.
1.2. OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT
The company is owned and managed by Derek Schops, who is currently the sole employee. Mr. Schops has built his experience working in retail in several positions polishing his communication and people skills. In addition, Derek has gathered the niche-specific knowledge working for supplement stores and gyms, giving him the adequate skill set for sales, supply chain management, logistics, and the ability to read the situation. 
The concept of Yaya Holistic has been in development for almost a decade; more precisely, since 2013. A health tragedy in his family pushed Mr. Schops to explore and devotedly study concepts of longevity and natural healing. 
He gradually expanded his network in the niche and recognized the market opportunity for high-quality supplements that can be sold under a recognizable Brand. Once his social media reach was adequate, he utilized the opportunity to launch the products under the Yaya brand and offer them world-wide through an online store.
1.3. KEY CAPABILITIES
SOCIAL MEDIA REACH
The initial social media following of 50,000 followers and the ability to connect with the target group has been the biggest contributor to the success of the Yaya brand. Mr. Schops created its Instagram page as a plant-based fitness enthusiast in 2019 and managed to quickly grow the number of followers. Currently, the page counts 36,000 followers due to the change in Derek’s focus on the management of all other aspects of the business.

BUSINESS NETWORK
Yaya Holistic considers its business network as one of the key factors for the current and future success of the company. The network spreads on both sales/marketing and supply chain business segments. 
On the one side, Mr. Schops has access to influencers on social media and leading names in the niche community of holistic healing, giving the company the ability to effectively promote their products and convert generated leads to sales.
On the other side, the company can adapt, diversify, and effectively manage the input cost of its product range as a result of the wide supplier network and knowledge about the supply chain in the industry. 
ONE-OF-A-KIND FORMULAS
Yaya Holistic recipes are unique in the industry. The formulas reflect the company’s plant-based nutrition concept and philosophy. They are a result of the experience and longstanding product development efforts put forth by the owner and a close network of family and friends.
1.4. MARKET LANDSCAPE
The healthcare market (Nutrition and Pharmaceutical) has evolved in recent years, extending the focus of their business to new areas, and addressing common consumer needs. The expansion of the business, together with the latest industry trends, has developed transversal and innovative market segments, focused on offering health and wellness benefits using natural ingredients and resources. Among the innovative segments, nutraceutical products are positioned as food with specific properties able to prevent and/or reduce certain diseases and enhance overall wellbeing. Dietary supplements are a part of the nutraceutical market.1 
During the COVID 19 pandemic, the demand for vitamins and supplements has soared, driven by the news that vitamins could help against the disease. This scenario is still positively affecting the demand for supplements and holistic needs. The pandemic has forever changed how people perceive the importance of a strong immune system and general wellbeing. Recent trends will enhance the awareness of consumers towards the benefits of nutraceutical products.
Recent surveys show the biggest generation in size – Millennials and the upcoming Gen Z give more importance to a healthy lifestyle, and that the tendency has increased more dramatically than in any other generation over the past decade. In addition, their concerns about health and the prevention of disease have strengthened during the pandemic.2


1.5. BUSINESS MODEL VALIDATION
The company has completed more than 3,500 orders since 2019 to date, generating more than $300,000 in sales and significant earnings for its owner. The Yaya brand is already well recognized in the niche, and the company strives to create a customer base that can add value back to the brand by providing valuable feedback and starting meaningful discussions. This allows us to achieve an impressive average order value per customer ($88.65 in 2021) with modest marketing budgets.
Yaya Holistic’s online store has a conversion rate of 6.54% in 2022, which in combination with the high average order value per customer creates a solid base for future growth fueled by investment in marketing and higher profitability as a result of lower cost per unit achieved by bulk inventory purchases financed from external sources.
1.6. BUSINESS GOALS
The short-term goal of the company is to fulfill more than 5,000 orders in 2024 while increasing its profit and working capital by investing in two key scaling factors – inventory and marketing.
The mid-term goals of Yaya Holistic are related to the business scaling. The company has designed a sound marketing strategy based on the best practices from the previous period to create a larger customer base that will be converted to more sales. In addition, Yaya intends to decrease its average cost per product further by utilizing external funding sources to invest in inventory, generating higher profitability. With stronger brand awareness and more comfortable margins, Yaya Holistic is entertaining the idea of listing its product in both large traditional chains like Whole Foods and on online marketplaces like Amazon. 
The long-term goal is to establish an Online University to teach and certify aspiring health enthusiasts as holistic practitioners through the Yaya certification program, who will gain the opportunity to dropship Yaya exclusive products and earn commission. 
1.7. INVESTMENT SUMMARY
The investment plan includes the purchase of inventory ($65,000) and the investment in social media and Google ads campaigns ($15,000 spent over 6 months period). The company aims to achieve a lower average price per unit and sufficient inventory levels to fulfill all orders while boosting website visits by investing in marketing.
1.8. LOAN PROPOSAL
Yaya Holistic is seeking loan financing for $80,000 at approximately a 10% annual interest rate over a 12-months repayment period.




2. THE MARKET
2.1. MARKET OVERVIEW
The dietary supplement industry in the US is a $59 billion industry according to Nutrition Business Journal (NBJ). Dietary supplement products include vitamins, minerals, botanicals, sports nutrition supplements, weight management products and specialty supplements. These products are intended to be used as supplements alongside, not substitutes for, a well-balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle. When used properly, they help promote overall optimal health and prevent disease. More than 200 million Americans take dietary supplements annually.

The dietary supplement industry increased in 2020 by $7B, as presented by Bill Geibler, content and insights director at Nutrition Business Journal (NBJ). The 14.5% growth rate is “a growth rate we haven’t seen in this industry since 1997,” said Geibler. Geibler revealed that the supplement market is projected to grow at a fast pace each year going forward. 3
According to PwC’s Vitamins & Dietary Supplements Market Trends Overview, traditional Pharmaceutical, Nutrition and Personal Care markets have evolved in recent years, extending the focus of their business to new areas and addressing common consumer needs. 
Nutraceutical, Cosmeceutical and Nutra-cosmetical markets are born as innovative and transversal segments to the more traditional markets. Those segments are focused on offering health and wellness benefits using natural ingredients and resources.
Vitamins and supplements as a part of the Nutraceutical market are usually taken in small doses concentrated to support the body's physiological functions, maintain health status, promote physical and mental well-being, or reduce the risk of disease.

Yaya Holistic is targeting Nutraceutical market segments with their plant-based supplements and in part the Cosmeceutical market segment with their Conscious Cosmetics product line for skin and hair.
2.2. COVID-19 IMPACT
The demand for immune-supporting products is to remain strong as we continue to live with COVID-19. People are more conscious about their health, and despite additional vaccine boosters administered all over the globe, people will want an extra layer of support.
Compared to the pre-pandemic levels, 29% of Americans are taking more supplements now, according to a survey conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of the Samueli Foundation.4
That same survey states that less than half of them claimed to have consulted their healthcare providers before taking them.
The medical director of the Meno Clinic’s Center for Functional Medicine (Wilson,WY), Mark Menolascino, MD, MS, ABIHM, ABAARM, IFMCP, with a background in primary-care medicine, offers his opinion on why supplement use has increased rapidly during the pandemic.
“Aside from masking and isolating, primary-care medicine wasn’t offering many actionable steps to protect a person’s lungs, optimize their immune system, or enhance detoxification. Supplements swooped into the rescue.” 5
The Yaya Holistic brand was developed as an alternative to more traditional allopathic practice. The holistic health company focuses on scientifically-backed evidence of healing with nature’s herbs. Mr. Schops started developing the concept back in 2013 after losing his father to cancer. Concepts of longevity and natural healing became the main focus of his formal and informal education. Those concepts came into focus during the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to be an important aspect of how we perceive our lives in the years to come.
2.3. INDUSTRY TRENDS 
Natural is the buzzing word not only in the supplements industry but also across health, food and beauty product industries. Generation Z and Millennials prefer to purchase natural products. This includes supplements. 
Younger shoppers are increasingly skeptical of prescription medication and wary of side effects. They want natural supplements that will actually bolster their cognitive resources and general health rather than just masking fatigue and overwhelm.6
Two main success factors can be identified as key to the current trends:
1) Younger consumers are also more open to alternative forms of medicine, nutrition, and healing, and are embracing health and wellness in unprecedented ways.
2) Consumers are savvier about health and nutrition. Generation Z and Millennials have access to more information than ever before. They now know the health implications of high sugar, caffeine, and processed ingredients, and are changing their focus to natural, organic and vegan products on the market.
The most recent trends are limitation diets such as vegan and carnivore. The purpose of limitation diets is to detox the body and reduce inflammation. Plant-based supplements under the Yaya brand are designed to work in combination with any diet, as its products are designed to detox the body and reduce inflammation with the power of well researched herbs and botanicals.
Beauty market and supplements
On a very basic level, it is understood that our health impacts our appearance; therefore, it is not difficult for consumers to accept that nutritional intervention can have a positive impact on skin, hair, and nail health. In clinical settings, dietary interventions have been a valuable way to treat symptoms of skin conditions. For example, a survey of 270 psoriasis patients found that over half tried between one to four dietary interventions or supplements to treat symptoms.7
2.4. TARGET MARKET PROFILE
Our biggest target is, but not limited to, plant-based and health-conscious individuals. The customer group also includes athletes, health advocates, fitness and diet enthusiasts, and those who choose to heal with alternative methods instead of pharmaceuticals. Yaya Holistic will be the “go-to” brand for herbal healing and would be a perfect fit for health food stores like Whole Foods.
Analytics show that Yaya Holistic is most popular amongst women. However, with an adequate marketing campaign the company can potentially broaden its target to other demographics as the desire for holistic healing is universal and awareness of all customer groups is on the rise due to the popularity of alternative solutions to traditional medicine.
2.5. LOCAL MARKET AND COMPETITORS
The US is the biggest market, mainly because the US has the largest sick population. However, being that Yaya Holistic is an e-commerce store it is able to reach many other countries. Also, social media has allowed the Yaya brand to connect with people from all parts of the world. In short, the health and wellness market is popular worldwide and the Yaya brand is not necessarily limited to local and surrounding markets in the geographical sense.
2.6. DIRECT COMPETITORS
When reducing Yaya Holistic down to a Supplement Company and not a niche-specific brand, then yes – Yaya has competition, other supplement companies.
However, Yaya offers formulas that no one else does. In fact, the supplement industry is notorious for white labeling products. To simplify, most “multivitamins” are the exact same formula from the exact same manufacturer – just with a different company label. This is where Yaya differs. All of Yaya Holistic products are unique and custom blends developed in-house and protected with a signed NDA from the manufacturer. In addition, the plant-based nutraceutical niche is relatively untouched. Yaya Holistic hopes to be the leading brand name in botanical alkaline plant-based blends for detox and regeneration.
2.7. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
INFLUENCER NETWORK
Yaya Holistic has solidified friendships and connections with major online influencers and celebrities. These individuals will be able to help rise brand awareness as well as give Yaya Holistic a positive reputation. Yaya Holistic is determined to become a brand that is used by health practitioners of all kinds, which gives an advantage in the proven drop-shipping business model. Dropshipping gives others the opportunity to sell high quality and trustworthy products without incurring any overhead fees, while earning a commission. 
SOCIAL MEDIA REACH
Mr. Schops has managed to gain an initial follower base of 50,000 with only his personal efforts. Even though the number of followers has fallen to 36,000 due to the owners’ engagement in other aspects of the business, the Yaya Holistic Instagram account is a unique resource – a great source of leads that can be converted into orders and a great base to be built on by hiring professional management to run the account and investing in marketing.
QUALITY AS A PRIORITY
Yaya Holistic is more than a supplement company, it is a representative of the health-conscious culture. Most supplement companies utilize cheaper, synthetic, and overly processed ingredients. Yaya Holistic strives to use only dry herbs that have been scientifically studied and are free from chemicals and other additives. There are many controversies about supplements using unregulated ingredients from China, and sourcing quality/ local ingredients is the Yaya’s main priority.
Even though other companies that enter the niche can adopt a similar strategy as Yaya Holistic, there will still be the challenge of navigating the logistics and the supply chain; the tasks that Yaya’s founder finds great success in.
ONE-OF-A-KIND RECIPES
Yaya Holistic recipes are a result of almost a decade of research and development funded by the owner before the company was established and during the first years in business. The key task is finding the balance between the efficiency of the plant-based blends and providing marketable and profitable products. Any company would need to allocate significant funds to research and development of their products even before it enters the niche market.

3. COMPANY DESCRIPTION
3.1. OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT
Mr. Schops possesses an AA degree in criminal justice, along several certifications as a holistic practitioner, detoxification specialist, and Iridologist (study of the iris and its correlation to cell degradation). A Bachelor’s degree in dietetics had to be postponed, as during the college years an unfortunate series of personal and financial events occurred.
During two and a half years since Yaya Holistic was established, Derek Schops (owner) has tested and strengthened its skills in supply chain and inventory management, marketing, customer acquisition and retention, and financial management. 
This skillset creates a solid foundation to be built on and will be crucial for the next stages of the company development.
3.2. BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS
Yaya Holistic has adopted integrated cost leadership and a focused differentiation strategy. 
Effective cost management is essential for the success of Yaya Holistic. Sales, marketing, product development, and inventory management are organized in-house and managed by the owner. Such an arrangement allows the business to achieve its objectives regarding revenues and profits while keeping its prices at optimal levels for sustainability. 
All of Yaya Holistic’s sales are done through the company website, using PayPal as the payment processor. The business relies heavily on marketing, low cost per sold unit, website traffic, and conversion and customer retention rates. 
The company is capable of handling more than twice the current number of orders. Negotiation with suppliers is handled by the owner, products are delivered to the home office already packed in branded bottles. Products are double packed into a shipping container provided by FedEx and shipped to customers by the currier.
Mr. Schops has successfully run all key aspects of the business for more than two years, increasing sales, and paving the way for larger investments in inventory and marketing to scale his business and take it to the next level.
Product formulas are developed in-house and are a result of long-term experience in the industry and initial investment in product development financed by the owner.
Most multi-vitamin supplements on the market have the exact same formula often from the same manufacturer – but with a different company label. This is where products under the Yaya brand differ. Only ingredients of the highest quality are used for our unique blends, and they are never compromised with any additives, chemicals, fillers, or artificial coloring. 


3.3. BUSINESS MODEL
CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL
Yaya Holistic offers its product through the online store yayaholistic.com. The online platform is based on Shopify software that enables detailed analytics of marketing and sales funnels. 
The e-commerce retail store is integrated with social media accounts; namely, the Yaya Holistic Instagram account which counts more than 35,000 followers and generates approx. one-third of total revenue through leads.
By using and putting emphasis on their unique formulas, the company is able to increase their customer base, but equally important, to increase their already impressive customer retention rates. The share of the returning customers in the total number of customers is 58.07% in 2021.
Yaya Holistic has sold more than 3,100 units of their products in 2021, continuing with a similar pace in 2022, recording 3% growth in the January – May period compared to the same period last year.
BUSINESS MODEL DEVELOPMENT
Yaya Holistic has several additions to its business model in the mid-term and long-term plans. 
1) Dropshipping – the company has created remarkable brand awareness with modest budgets through promotional efforts by its owner. The company plans to upgrade their promotional efforts to increase its social media reach by investing in content and social media marketing. Yaya Holistic will offer the opportunity to other similar online and brick-and-mortar retailers to offer their one-of-a-kind formulas by dropshipping.
2) Online University - sovereignty is a concept that Derek values and uses to navigate his career and life choices. Therefore, learning about law and health is not only a passion of his but it is exactly what he wants to give back to the world; the ability to empower others by providing knowledge for individuals to take control of their health and individuality. Yaya Holistic is in the process of developing a concept of its own certification program. The training and the earned certificate will enable graduates to properly promote alkaline nutrition, a conscious lifestyle, Yaya products, and give adequate advice to their customers and gain access to the dropshipping option. In that way, owners of the certificate can manage their own successful businesses, by benefiting from the recognizable Yaya brand and utilizing its logistics and our knowledge of the supply chain, without incurring any overhead fees like most start-ups do.  
3) Supplement production facility – an investment in a production line is a sensible step in the long-term strategy for Yaya Holistic, giving the company three main advantages: lower production costs, in-house quality assurance, and additional options in the product range, giving the company an extra competitive advantage (i.e. custom supplement blends). The investment in the production facility includes production premises lease, purchase of the equipment, and hiring staff in manufacturing and quality assurance positions.
4) Telehealth and custom blends – the company aims to build a network of holistic practitioners to outsource advisory services for its potential and existing customers. The practitioners would have the option to offer the unique Yaya Holistic products that are part of the standard product range and to offer custom blends that would be tailor-made in line with the specific needs of each customer.
3.4. PRODUCT RANGE
Our product range can be divided to 4 main categories:
1) Plant-based blends, our most popular products.

3.5. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
The short-term goals of the company are related to the scaling of the business. The company has a clear strategy to increase its sales while keeping the size of its business operations at the current level. Yaya Holistic plans to fulfill more than 5,000 orders in 2024, by investing in key generators of the company’s success – marketing and inventory, and increasing their website traffic while keeping the inventory levels sufficient to fulfill every order (which is not the case currently).
Mid-term plans of the company include adding new sales channels and profit centers – adding services and online certification to the Yaya brand, and utilizing drop shipping and sales in both traditional and online stores (Whole Foods, Amazon, etc.).
The biggest shift in the business of Yaya Holistic would be an investment in a production facility. The owner is aware of the challenges the company can face establishing such a facility – labor requirements, abiding by the legal and regulatory framework, lease of a property, management team expansion, etc. However, this step would have a significant positive effect on the various segments of the business – from procurement and inventory management, through quality assurance to capability for exponential scaling. By controlling every step of the business process, Yaya Holistic would be able to offer large batches to retailers like Whole Foods and Amazon increasing brand recognition while generating sustainable profit margins and keeping quality on the highest level.
3.6. LABOR REQUIREMENTS
With the current setup, Mr. Schops is capable of handling more than 5,000 orders regarding both procurement and customer order management. 
Yaya outsources financial reporting and accounting to outside experts (bookkeeper, tax preparer, and accountant). The built-in Shopify analytics on its website and the information from the PayPal platform (Company’s merchant) helps the company track and manage all finances in a frictionless manner, with the help of QuickBooks. 
So far, the company has utilized in-house resources for marketing efforts, following the drive and vision of its owner, with the help of friends and family. However, it became obvious that the owner can’t effectively manage the business and deal with the time-consuming task of maintaining the social media presence to keep up with the social media algorithms. Even though Mr. Schops plans to further develop his online presence, social media accounts and marketing campaign management will be outsourced to marketing agencies and other influencers.
3.7. LOCATION AND OUTLAY 
The company utilizes a virtual office which grants it access to a physical address in Boca Raton, Florida. However, Yaya Holistic is operated primarily from a home office. Inventory is stored in the home storage unit.
Yaya Holistic will continue to develop as an e-commerce brand, opening a store at a physical location is not planned in the short-term.
3.8. SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS
Yaya Holistic formulates its own products, a manufacturer produces them, then they are offered through the online store.
3.9. MISSION AND VISION
Yaya Holistic’s Mission statement is as follows:
Company Vision can be summarized as follows:


3.10. LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE
Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.
FDA regulates both finished dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients. FDA regulates dietary supplements under a different set of regulations than those covering "conventional" foods and drug products. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA).
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to create a new regulatory framework for dietary supplements. Under DSHEA, FDA does not have the authority to approve dietary supplements before they are marketed. Generally, a firm does not have to provide FDA with the evidence it relies on to substantiate safety before or after it markets its products.
Under the FD&C Act, a firm is responsible for ensuring that the dietary supplements it manufactures or distributes are not adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise in violation of federal law. If a manufacturer or distributor makes a structure/function claim (a claim about effects on a structure or function of the human body), a claim of a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease, or a claim of general well-being in the labeling of a dietary supplement, the firm must have substantiation that the claim is truthful and not misleading.8
The company plans to complete the trademarking process to prevent copying of its name or/and logo by another company and enhance the trust in Yaya brand. The company estimates that the process will cost around $3,000.


4. MARKETING STRATEGY
4.1. POSITIONING
Yaya Holistic’s market positioning is based on high quality ingredients at reasonable prices thanks to its effective cost management and wide range of in-house capabilities. 
The company sees itself as a niche brand and one of the leading Brands in the vegan-friendly herbal dietary supplements market.
4.2. BRANDING
Yaya Holistic aims to enable customers to do more with their lives through its brand. The company is not limiting its brand to the sale of products, Yaya plans to build an ecosystem in which two-way communication is fostered between the company and its customers. On the one side, Yaya Holistic is a go-to source of information for its customers, and on the other, the concept gives customers an opportunity to add back value back to the brand and its community by actively communicating brand values to their surroundings and giving feedback about the company’s products and services. 
Branding is something that Derek is confident with as he considers himself a visionary. With this being said, it is important to have a team that can help develop and grow Derek’s initial ideas as well as offer corrections.
The logo and design of the bottle containers were completed in 2020 by the company. Yaya Holistic’s short-term plans include investment into the unboxing experience of their products by branding shipping packaging and creating a wide range of educational content that will be developed for social media to promote regenerative nutrition and include general topics on health and wellbeing.
4.3. SALES STRATEGY AND TACTICS
Yaya Holistic’s business strategy revolves around the concept of promoting the undisputable healing power of nature while supporting its efforts with scientifically backed evidence.
Sales strategy is based on the integration of the online store with social media accounts and the utilization of marketing tools that increase website traffic.
The company is using the Shopify platform for their online store and PayPal as a merchant. Shopify provides detailed analytics on sources of the website traffic and how the traffic is converted to sales. The analysis of the sale data identifies the main sales generators and gives the company the opportunity to test how different prices and marketing efforts influence the number of orders and conversion rates it receives. 
While the website is currently the only revenue source, Yaya Holistic is planning to develop its online presence further by introducing telehealth services into its offer. In addition, with the increase of their brand awareness, the company believes that dropshipping can be a major revenue generator with online and traditional retailers offering their products, as well as influencers offering their products through the combination of affiliate marketing and drop shipping. 
4.4. PRICING STRATEGY
In line with the positioning of our brand and overall business philosophy, Yaya Holistic strives to offer high-quality products at reasonable prices. By utilizing effective supply chain and logistics management, and by keeping operations cost-efficient, the company is able to offer very competitive prices while keeping profitability levels sufficient for the long-term sustainability of the business. 
4.5. ACTION PLAN
The company is planning to achieve three main goals with its marketing efforts:
1) To influence a large number of people and become a reputable source of information on the benefits of the holistic approach to health and of the individual, alkaline lifestyle, and the role of nutrition in achieving optimal health
2) To increase the recognition of the Yaya brand
3) To promote products under the Yaya Brand in a non-aggressive and organic way. This strategy goes in line with the value-based brand strategy. The company prioritizes promotion of well-being and optimal health, while offering its products as tools for their customers to achieve it
YAYA HOLISTIC INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT
Mr. Schops created its Instagram page in 2019 and gained 50,000 followers with essentially no marketing budget, using quality content and his personal network of contacts to promote the account.
The company has designated a budget of $2,000 per month for a marketing agency that will include Instagram account management and the creation of the optimal amount of new content to increase the number of followers and reach of social media posts. 
AFFILIATE SALES WITH INFLUENCERS
By offering social media influencers a commission and free products, we see major opportunities to scale based on our previous proof of concept with our own Instagram account using modest budgets. The company will start by offering commission of 10%.
INTERNET MARKETING
Yaya Holistic utilizes social media marketing and Google ads to boost their website traffic and consequently the number of customers’ orders. 


PROMOTIONS AND DISCOUNTS
Discounts have been proven as an effective tool for boosting sales and conversion rates. Yaya Holistic uses Shopify analytics to set optimal discount rates to achieve a maximum boost in order numbers while keeping profitability at a sustainable level.
NATIVE MARKETING
The company plans to produce educational content for multiple channels (Instagram, Youtube, etc.) by outsourcing projects to local marketing agencies. The goal is to place advertising in a non-disruptive way – the reader is exposed to advertising content while useful content regarding alkaline lifestyle is consumed.
4.6. CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AND BUDGETS
The largest part of the online store’s web traffic is generated by the Yaya Instagram account. The Shopify analytics show that around 50% of website visits in 2021, or 14,000 visits in total, came from the Instagram account. Considering that Mr. Schops is engaged in all other aspects of the business, account management will be outsourced to a marketing agency. They will be responsible for several tasks, including content creation for all platforms, which is why their fixed monthly rate of $2,000 is included in the projection as a fixed cost rather than in the marketing budgets. A gradual increase of visits coming from this source was projected as a result of professional account management and new content.
Affiliate marketing will be an important component of the marketing strategy as we believe that it will both generate new leads and increase the reach of our brand. Yaya Holistic is planning to test several partnered Instagram accounts (influencers) and chose accounts with the highest conversion rates and average order value. Website traffic and sales will be tracked through UTM links and promo codes during checkout. The company will offer a 10% sales commission to Instagram partners. Even though a higher impact on website traffic can be expected, a conservative 10% share was used as an assumption for the projection.
Cost per click for social media and Google ads projection is based on online resources9 and internal data generated by testing.

5. RISK ASSESSMENT
Risk typeExposure levelMitigationSupply chain bottlenecksModerateShortages of ingredients can be a limiting factor; however, the supplements supply chain is recovering as many others and the risk can be mitigated by planning and bulk purchases.Supplier dependencyLowThere are many producers of supplements in the market, substitution is possible in a timely manner with low switching costs.Security riskModerateRecipes can be copied as it is very difficult to patent a recipe. However, unique blends are connected with the brand and the narrative around the brand explains why recipes cannot be copied without significant cost.Key person dependencyHighMr. Schops is a key person for the business. However, he has proven his business management skills and his long-term commitment to its success.Market riskModerateYaya Holistic targets a very specific niche,  which is why possible competition influence is limited.Investment riskLowThe investment plans are prudent and sensible. Keeping in mind that the company already has pre-orders in place for its products, risks can be assessed as very low.Financial riskModerateThe company plans to strengthen its solvency and liquidity by investing in key aspects of its business – marketing and inventory, to increase profitability and working capital.


6. FINANCIAL ASSESSMENT
6.1. THE INVESTMENT
The investment in inventory and marketing can be assessed as a sensible step in this phase of the company’s development. Yaya Holistic has tested its business model against the challenging market conditions during the pandemic and has proven that the demand for its products is high and that profitability levels are sufficient for a sustainable business. 
The investment in inventory is a necessity because the online store had to organize pre-orders several times as the level of inventory was not sufficient to fulfill all the orders. The company plans to buy 12 months’ worth of products to decrease the average price per product by getting the bulk purchase discount and creating a solid working capital base.
Investment plans also include promotional campaigns on social media and Google, 6 months period from August 2022 until January 2023 would be financed by a loan. Yaya Holistic will continue with campaigns after that period and finance them from their own sources.

6.3. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
6.3.1. Income Statement Analysis
Yaya Holistic was incorporated in 2020 and the company has gone through a process of stabilization in 2021. 
The main strategy in 2021 was to re-invest all disposable gross profit into future revenue generators – marketing, content and branding, and to prepare the business for scaling.
By testing several types of internet marketing Yaya Holistic gathered the data that will help them to invest in solutions that will generate the highest return on investment.

6.3.2. Web Store Metrics
Even though the number of website visitors remained at the same level, Yaya Holistic has managed to achieve several impressive goals with its strategy:
1) Conversion rate of 6.54%– this metric shows that the company is using adequate channels to steer potential customers to its website. By comparison, the average conversion rate of a website in the US is 2.63%10 while the average conversion rate for Health & Wellbeing websites is around 2%.11
2) Returning customer rate of 58.07% – a rate between 20% and 40% is considered good depending on the industry. 
3) Average order value of $84.04 – the company tested several prices and discount campaigns to increase the average order value. The realistic average order value with the current product range is between $85 and $90.

6.3.3. Balance Sheet Analysis
Mr. Schops has invested $56,652 into the business in 2020 and 2021, of which $24,435 is left at the end of 2021 after draws and personal expenses. However, when investments prior to the incorporation are taken into consideration regarding product and market research, branding, marketing, and other aspects of the business that are key for the current and future success of Yaya Holistic, the owner’s investment can be considered significantly higher than the balance sheet shows.
The company invested $24,960 into video production equipment in 2021. As a result, the company is capable of creating content for social media in-house, which will be the main and the cheapest source of visits to their online store.

The balance sheet structure is simple and typical for an online store. The key goals of the company for the following period are to increase its working capital by reinvesting earnings in the business and to establish a strong base to finance the projected growth from its own sources.

ASSUMPTIONS – 2022 INCOME STATEMENT
1) Sales levels for January – April period are based on Shopify analytics for that period
2) An increase in the number of orders was projected for May – July period of 2022 as a new shipment of products is expected to arrive. Yaya Holistic is currently accepting pre-orders only for its most popular Multi Mineral Blend as it is out of stock. The shipment will be sufficient for three months.
3) After financing is secured in August 2022, a larger amount of inventory will be purchased, and a part of the funds will be directed to marketing. The investment will result in higher sales and higher average order value. The company has tested the optimal price level that results in the highest average order value. A conservative approach was used for the average order value projection - $90, a lower amount compared to the yearly average of $91.62 in 2021.  
4) Higher website traffic and order numbers were projected in November and December during the holiday season.
5) An increase in gross profit margin was projected based on the following table. With larger orders to suppliers, Yaya Holistic will decrease the average price per unit sold by utilizing discounts for bulk purchases. An average discount of 5% was used in the projection.

The assumptions that are key for the projected number of orders are based on the existing data collected via Shopify analytics and the actual performance of the Yaya Holistic web store (Sessions per Visitor, Conversion Rate, and Returning Customer Rate). While improvements can be expected regarding these metrics as a result of the marketing efforts, a conservative approach was used for the assumptions, leading to why the projected outcomes can be assessed as reasonable.
